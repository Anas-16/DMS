# Dissertation Management System API

A secure and robust backend API built with **Java and Spring Boot** to modernise and streamline the process of managing university dissertations. This system provides role-based access for students and administrators, JWT-based security, and a full suite of CRUD operations for academic works.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Secure Authentication:** Utilises **Spring Security** with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to secure all API endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated and authorised users can access protected resources.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implements a clear distinction between `STUDENT` and `ADMIN` roles, restricting access to sensitive operations like approving or rejecting dissertations.
* **Full Dissertation Lifecycle Management:** Complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality for dissertation records.
* **Powerful Search Capability:** An endpoint to search for dissertations by keywords in their title, powered by Spring Data JPA-derived queries.
* **Modern Cloud Database Integration:** Connects to a **PostgreSQL** database hosted on **Supabase**, demonstrating experience with modern cloud database providers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* JDK 17 or later
* Apache Maven
* A PostgreSQL database (you can create a free one on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/))

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Anas-16/dms.git](https://github.com/Anas-16/dms.git)
    cd dms
    ```

2.  **Configure your database:**
    * Navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
    * Update the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` properties with your own PostgreSQL database credentials.
    * It's highly recommended to use environment variables for these secrets in a production environment.

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`. You can test the connection by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/ping`.
